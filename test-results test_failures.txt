Test Results - Login Tests
============================
Run Date: 2025-11-13
Total Tests: 5
Passed: 0
Failed: 5

FAILURES:
---------

1. test_successful_login
   FAILED: NoSuchElementException
   Message: Unable to locate element: {"method":"xpath","selector":"/html/body/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/form/div[1]/input"}
   
   The element at the specified XPath could not be found. The DOM structure
   appears to have changed. Current page structure shows the form is now nested
   differently in the DOM tree.

2. test_login_validation
   FAILED: NoSuchElementException
   Message: Unable to locate element: {"method":"xpath","selector":"//button[1]"}
   
   Multiple buttons found on page, but the first button is now a "Close" button
   for a modal dialog, not the submit button. Index-based selectors are unreliable.

3. test_forgot_password_link
   FAILED: NoSuchElementException
   Message: Unable to locate element: {"method":"xpath","selector":"//div[@class='form-container']/form/div[5]/a[1]"}
   
   The form structure changed. The forgot password link is no longer in div[5],
   it's now in a separate container outside the form.

4. test_remember_me_checkbox
   FAILED: NoSuchElementException
   Message: Unable to locate element: {"method":"xpath","selector":"/html/body/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/form/div[3]/label/input"}
   
   Absolute XPath broke after UI redesign. The checkbox is still present but
   in a different location in the DOM tree.

5. test_social_login_buttons
   FAILED: NoSuchElementException
   Message: Unable to locate element: {"method":"xpath","selector":"//div[@class='social-login']/button[1]"}
   
   Order of social login buttons changed. Facebook is now first, followed by
   Google. Position-based selectors are not reliable.

ANALYSIS:
---------
All failures are due to brittle XPath selectors that rely on:
- Absolute paths from html/body
- Position-based selectors (div[1], button[1], etc.)
- Specific DOM structure that changed during UI updates

RECOMMENDATIONS:
----------------
1. Use stable attributes like ID, name, or data-testid
2. Avoid absolute XPaths
3. Use relative XPaths with meaningful attributes
4. Consider CSS selectors as alternative
5. Use text-based selectors where appropriate
